The Ben-Or algorithm can be used to solve Binary Consensus with faults.

\begin{theorem}{}{}
    The above algorithm is correct.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Validity is clear: if all nodes start with $v$, then we skip to 
    %TODO finish proof
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}{}{}
    The expected number of rounds of \nameref{alg:ben-or} is $2^{n-1}$.
    Additionally, with high probability, the number of rounds is less than
    $2^{n-1}\ln{n}$.
